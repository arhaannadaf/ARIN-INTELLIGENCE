09-01-2026,united_states,Reuters,"US legal jobs hit new high, labor data shows","There are more people than ever working in the U.S. legal sector, preliminary data released Friday by the U.S. Labor Department showed. Legal sector employment totaled a record-breaking 1,208,100 jobs last month, according to preliminary seasonally adjusted data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The count includes a range of legal workers at companies, law firms, government agencies and nonprofits, including paralegals and assistants, but the majority are lawyers, according to BLS. December's historic high follows several record-breaking months for U.S. legal sector employment, though the November and December figures are still subject to revision.
Overall U.S. employment growth slowed more than expected in December amid job losses in the construction, retail and manufacturing sectors, but a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.4% suggested the labor market was not rapidly deteriorating.
Large and midsized U.S. law firms enjoyed a highly profitable 2025 thanks to soaring client demand and ever-higher billing rates, though a contraction could be possible in 2026, according to a report released this week by the Thomson Reuters Institute and Georgetown Lawâ€™s Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession. The Thomson Reuters Institute and Reuters share the same parent company.Both the Great Recession and the pandemic reversed years of gains in legal industry employment, an August 2025 Reuters review of 35 years of BLS data found. It took until 2022 for employment in the sector to rebound to an earlier peak of 1,179,500 jobs recorded in May 2007, when a period of propulsive growth had increased the number of legal jobs by 26.3% since 1990.",economic

The S&P 500, Dow and the STOXX 600 notched record high closes. Chip stocks rose and helped to boost the S&P 500, with Intel (INTC.O), opens new tab gaining 10.8% after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a ""great meeting"" with the chipmaker's Chief Executive Officer, Lip-Bu Tan. Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab rose 3.8%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly report showed 50,000 workers were added to nonfarm payrolls in December, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a rise of 60,000, just above November's downwardly revised increase of 56,000. The unemployment rate eased, as expected, to 4.4%.
""Payrolls were a little bit light relative to consensus, but still fairly strong numbers,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""We are back to normal in terms of economic reporting, so that's a bit of a relief for everyone.""
Before now, the release of U.S. economic data had been delayed because of the long federal government shutdown. Stock market gains this week came despite increased geopolitical tensions sparked by U.S. forces capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid on its capital January 3.

12-01-2026,singapore,Reuters,Investors react as Trump-Fed feud escalates,"Tensions between the White House and the U.S. central bank sharply escalated over the weekend, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell saying the administration had threatened him with a criminal indictment related to the Fed headquarters renovation.
Powell called the threats a ""pretext"" aimed at putting pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates. The U.S. dollar fell broadly, U.S. stock futures slid and Treasury futures rallied.Here is what investors and market analysts are saying about the rift:
KARL SCHAMOTTA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CORPAY, TORONTO:
""Tonight's revelations mark a dramatic escalation in the administration's effort to kick the legs out from under the Fed, and could unleash a series of unintended consequences that go directly against President Trump's stated aims.
""By trying to influence the central bank through aggressive legal threats against individual officials, the administration could drive inflation expectations higher, erode the dollar's safe-haven role, and trigger a sharp rise in long-term bond yields that raises borrowing costs across the American economy.""Pouring gasoline everywhere and then playing with matches tends not to work out well.""
PRASHANT NEWNAHA, SENIOR ASIA-PACIFIC RATES STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, SINGAPORE:
""Markets are likely to greet this news as another chapter in the long-running saga about the loss of Fed independence. Developments are dollar and rates negative, but precious metals are positive. Short-term impacts should be limited. Ultimately, the Fed is accountable to Congress, not the President.""
JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF CRESSET CAPITAL, CHICAGO:
""Powell's term as Fed chair ends in May, so this may be a ploy to get him off the committee altogether.
""Investors are going to be concerned about the independence of the Federal Reserve going forward, especially since part of what we are expecting this year is not just more rate cuts than the dot plot would suggest but also quantitative easing. DAMIEN BOEY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WILSON ASSET MANAGEMENT, SYDNEY
""Fed Chair Powell has deviated from his previous approach to Trump's threats, this time choosing to directly address the elephant in the room - that the Fed is not moving rates as the President would like.
""In response to the announcement of a criminal investigation, gold has strengthened, equities have wobbled, and the yield curvehas steepened a little. These moves have been broadly consistent with the playbook for an attack on the Fedâ€™s independence.
""What has been interesting, however, is that the yield curve has bull steepened initially (rather than bear steepened), because bond investors have taken the view that the Fed is already moving directionally with the President (rate cuts), and that its Reserve Management Purchases (RMPs) of bonds, are helping to suppress rates volatility.",political_economy
12-01-2026,china,Reuters,China taps export controls veteran for senior trade post ahead of Trump visit,"China on Monday appointed Jiang Chenghua as Deputy Representative for International Trade Negotiations, a veteran negotiator with experience in export controls and in managing the country's investment ties with the U.S.
Jiang replaces Li Yongjie, who in October was named as China's representative to the World Trade Organization, as Beijing prepares for an April visit by U.S. President Donald Trump. At the same time, Beijing is turning its attention to pressuring Japan over remarks by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi regarding Taiwan, by leveraging its export control frameworks. Trade diplomats say Beijing has upgraded the calibre of its negotiators since Trump first targeted China during his previous time in the White House, with some believing that China may now hold the upper hand at the negotiating table.
A trade lawyer by training, Jiang previously headed up the commerce ministry's import-export control division and worked on negotiations for a China-U.S. bilateral investment treaty, launched in 2008 but shelved in 2017 after Trump took office.
China's global trading partners were stunned when Beijing sharply broadened its rare earth export controls in October, a response triggered by U.S. lawmakers' moves to further curb Chinese investment in the world's top consumer market. Analysts say the escalation likely reflected Beijing's calculation that demonstrating its ability to choke critical supply chains would remind Washington of the leverage China holds should Trump press too far.
Japanese firms fear Beijing is preparing to wield rare earth export curbs again after China banned shipments of dual-use items to military users earlier this month, including certain rare-earth elements critical to Japan's automotive industry.",political_economy
12-01-2026,global,Economic Times,"Andrew Freris on political pressure on the Fed, soaring gold and where to invest in a â€˜Messyâ€™ world","Global markets are navigating an increasingly complex landscape as political tensions, policy uncertainty and record asset prices collide. Against this backdrop, Andrew Freris, CEO, Ecognosis Advisory offered his take on ET Now, flagging concerns over political interference in U.S. institutions, questioning the logic behind the commodity rally and warning investors against complacency in American equities.â€œThere is absolutely no news, except that now, for me, it is much more important that the Department of Justice in the United States is being completely forced by the President to start a criminal investigation, which the Department of Justice knows very well has nothing to do with criminal activity in the Fed. This is simply to browbeat and possibly threaten the Fed. It is very sad to see that justice in the United States is now losing its independence,â€ he said. Freris added that repeated criticism of former President Donald Trump had limited value for investors at this stage. It is now getting a little bit boring and of very little value added to carry on criticising Trump, because there are so many things that you can criticise him for. We will be spending unnecessary time picking points, as opposed to saying where it is possible to make money in this very, very messy period. I am sorry, I am being very blunt,â€ he remarked.Turning to commodities, Freris expressed scepticism about the renewed rally in precious metals, even as gold crossed 4,500 and silver surged to $83.â€œI find it very sweet that here is Trump threatening to invade several Latin American countries, potentially have another go at Iran, and people buy gold. Remember, they are buying gold only on the expectation that other people later on will be buying gold. For me, it is such a sweet, childish reaction, but there you go â€” that is the way the market is behaving,â€ he said.While he acknowledged goldâ€™s physical value compared to digital assets, he dismissed fear-driven buying as an investment strategy.â€œAt least in relation to Bitcoin, gold you can actually hold it, melt it, jump on it, make it into rings, whereas with Bitcoin, there is absolutely nothing behind it. But the reaction that if there is a crack in the heavens, you immediately go and buy gold â€” it is very sweet, but completely unbacked other than the expectation that other people will do exactly the same. That is not a way to invest money, but never mind, there you go,â€ he added.On U.S. equities trading at all-time highs amid expectations of rate cuts, Freris was unequivocal in his view that investors should look elsewhere.â€œYou are not going to make money in the American markets. It is only about 12 days since the end of last year. Last year, the S&P was an atrociously poor performer at 15%. South Korea was, I do not know, four times bigger than that. All the EU markets were 30% and over,â€ he said.He argued that American markets had underperformed globally and warned that domestic political risks were being underestimated. â€œThe American markets were a lousy performer, and I say that with no fear of contradiction. The domestic situation in the States is in the hands of an administration which is incredibly dangerous to run the biggest and most powerful country in the world,â€ Freris cautioned.As for where investors should deploy capital, his answer was stark and controversial.â€œThere are plenty of other places where you can make money. More than ever, defence â€” buy guns. The Americans are actually telling the world, â€˜Do not expect us to defend you.â€™ What would be my reaction to that? I would buy more guns, of course,â€ he said.Summing up his stance, Freris concluded that sectoral opportunities existed outside the U.S., particularly in defence-related industries.If you are asking me where to put your money, not in the States. If you are asking me which sector to put your money in, the answer is defence â€” anywhere defence, except the United States, of course.â€",political_economy
12-01-2026,global,Economic Times,Gold jumps to record high on Fed subpoenas and Iran tensions,"Gold jumped to a record high as the US Justice Department threatened the Federal Reserve with a criminal indictment, while intensifying protests in Iran kept geopolitical tensions elevated. Bullion rose to just shy of $4,600 an ounce on Monday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank had been served grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department related to his June congressional testimony on renovations of the Fedâ€™s headquarters. The move marked an escalation of President Donald Trumpâ€™s feud with Powell and also renewed worries over the independence of the monetary authority. Deadly protests in Iran, meanwhile, increased the haven appeal of precious metals, with the possibility that the Islamic Republic could be overthrown injecting uncertainty into geopolitics and oil markets. Trump said Sunday he was mulling potential options on Iran, while also reiterating threats to take Greenland and questioning the value of the NATO alliance, just over a week after seizing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. â€œItâ€™s a reminder of how many uncertainties markets are juggling â€” geopolitics, the growth/rates debate, and now a fresh headline-driven reminder of an institutional risk premium,â€ said Charu Chanana, a strategist from Saxo Markets in Singapore.Gold just emerged from a record-setting year, where almost every tailwind supporting the precious metal combined, from falling interest rates and heightened geopolitical tension, to lower trust in the US dollar. More than a dozen money managers said theyâ€™ve opted not to take too much money off the table, holding conviction in bullionâ€™s long-term appeal.Last weekâ€™s US jobs data left expectations for additional US interest-rate cuts intact, supporting non-yielding precious metals. The US employment report showed job growth was below forecasts last month, supporting bets the Federal Reserve will continue cutting borrowing costs to support the economy. Silver also traded just shy of a all-time peak.Markets have priced in at least two cuts this year, after the Fed delivered three consecutive reductions in the second half, aiding gold which doesnâ€™t pay interest.Gold rose 1.7% to $4,585.39 an ounce as of 9:08 a.m. Singapore time. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dipped 0.2%. Silver jumped 4.6%, after surging nearly 10% last week. Palladium and platinum advanced.The US Supreme Court, meanwhile failed to weigh in on Trumpâ€™s tariffs, setting Wednesday for the next opinion. A ruling against the levies would undercut his signature economy policy and deliver his biggest legal defeat since returning to the White House.",geopolitical_economy
12-01-2026,global,Reuters,Morning Bid: Powell's punch back jolts markets,"A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee
Investors are still wrapping their heads around the latest escalation in the tussle between U.S. President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve, with Chair Jerome Powell fighting back against the effort to control the Fed and interest rates. Growing unrest in Iran, where more than 500 people have been killed, according to a rights group, also underscored the geopolitical challenges markets are navigating at the start of 2026, keeping safe-haven assets well supported. Markets began trade on Monday with the bombshell that the Trump administration had threatened to indict Powell over Congressional testimony he gave last summer about a Fed building renovation project. Powell says it's a ""pretext"" to gain more influence over the central bank and monetary policy.
""This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions - or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,"" Powell said, opens new tab.
The market's immediate reaction was to sell the dollar and take stock futures lower, although what it means for interest rates isn't so clear. Gold prices cracked $4,600 per ounce for the first time as investors sought safety. The news was unsettling but market reaction was measured. There were no signs of panic selling as investors await clarity on the implications to the Fed's autonomy and where rates head in the near term.
Perhaps markets now broadly expect the Fed to kowtow to Trump and cut rates freely once the new Fed chief settles in after May when Powell's term ends. Futures pricing still shows two rate cuts priced in for the year.
With Japanese markets closed on Monday, there was no cash trading in Treasuries in Asian hours. The focus will be on the Treasury market once London opens.",political_economy

The largest U.S. lender, JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), opens new tab , will kick off earnings season for banks on Jan. 13. Citigroup (C.N), opens new tab, Bank of America (C.N), opens new tab and Wells Fargo (WFC.N), opens new tab will report on Jan. 14, and Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), opens new tab on Jan. 15. Their results are likely to be bolstered by a revival in mergers and acquisitions. The fourth quarter shaped up to be a perfect recipe in the consecutive buildup for investment banking revenues,"" said Stephen Biggar, a banking analyst at Argus Research. He cited ""an improving IPO calendar, to a surge in M&A activity, to continued elevated trading activity across commodities, fixed income and equities,"" as factors that lifted earnings.
Global investment banking revenue rose 15% from a year earlier to almost $103 billion, the second-highest since 2021, with JPMorgan leading the league table, Dealogic data showed. Mergers and acquisitions volume surged to $5.1 trillion in 2025 up 42% from 2024, driven by global megadeals, the data showed. Goldman Sachs topped the M&A rankings. PRO-GROWTH AGENDA
Analysts expect results to benefit from broad loan growth and expansion in net interest margin, a measure of how much a bank earns from interest and pays out on deposits. Both those factors are expected to support earnings this year, the analysts said. Banks will generate more business from loans next year because of President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies, lighter regulations, lower interest rates, and changes to capital rules, Jason Goldberg, Barclays banking analyst wrote in a note.
Meanwhile, a healthy economy will also support bank earnings this year, said Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop.
""We still expect solid U.S. GDP growth in nominal terms and do not pencil in a recession,"" he said. While a slowdown in job growth could dent consumer demand and increase late payments from borrowers, those delinquencies will have little impact on banks' results, he added. ""The biggest variable we're monitoring heading into earnings and the new year is what happens with inflation,"" Dunlop said.
A combination of tariffs, fiscal stimulus and tax cuts could reduce rate cut expectations, even when the central bank appoints a new chair, Dunlop said. If rates remain elevated, asset prices could stay high while deal flow subsides, he said.
An S&P index of bank stocks has risen about 3% so far this year after climbing 30% last year. Here is what analysts expect from the six biggest U.S. lenders in the fourth quarter:
JPMORGAN CHASE
The lender is expected to show its earnings per share rose more than 3% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, driven by strong investment banking fees and markets revenue, according to LSEG estimates.
JPMorgan's investment banking revenue is expected to rise by low-single digit percentages in the fourth quarter, while it expects markets revenue to be up in the low-teens percentages, an executive told investors at a conference last month.
Investors are likely to focus on its spending plans for 2026. Its shares sank last month after the executive said expenses will climb.
BANK OF AMERICA
EPS is likely to jump nearly 17%, LSEG estimates, helped by higher net interest income -- the amount the bank makes on loans and pays out on deposits -- and increased trading revenue.
Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan expects markets revenue to rise between a high single-digit percentage and 10% in the fourth quarter, while investment banking fees will be broadly flat, he told investors last month.
CITIGROUP
Analysts see Citigroup's EPS surging 32%, fueled by gains in capital markets.
Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said last month that investment banking fees are expected to jump in the fourth quarter, buoyed by dealmaking.
WELLS FARGO
Wells Fargo is expected to post an 17.5% rise in EPS in the fourth quarter, fueled by higher NII and strong investment banking, where the lender is hiring and setting more ambitious targets.
Investors are focused on the bank's growth plans after its $1.95 trillion asset cap was lifted by regulators in 2025.
GOLDMAN SACHS
The Wall Street investment banking giant is likely to see a nearly 4.9% decline in EPS, after profit surged to a three-year high in the fourth quarter of 2024.
The bank will benefit from strong M&A advisory fees, but is unlikely to sustain more volatile gains from equity investments in its asset management unit in 2024, analysts said.
Analysts at Well Fargo said they expect Goldman's revenue from private banking to slide due to lower NII, while compensation costs will be higher for the group.
MORGAN STANLEY
Morgan Stanley's EPS is estimated to rise by more than 8%, helped by investment banking revenue.
Citigroup analysts said for wealth management - a core business for Morgan Stanley - it expects another quarter of low-double digit growth, benefiting from the strong equities market.
Morgan Stanley's profit beat estimates in the third quarter as a surge in dealmaking drove revenue to records, and the company's finance chief said its investment banking pipeline is at ""all-time highs.""

With the Islamic Republic's clerical establishment facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if force is used on protesters.
According to its latest figures - from activists inside and outside Iran - U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 490 protesters and 48 security personnel, with more than 10,600 people arrested in two weeks of unrest. Iran has not given an official toll and Reuters was unable to independently verify the tolls.
Trump was to be briefed by his officials on Tuesday on options over Iran including military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources, the Wall Street Journal said on Sunday.
Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf warned Washington against ""a miscalculation"". ""Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target,"" said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards. AUTHORITIES INTENSIFY CRACKDOWN
The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, before turning against the clerical rulers who have governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Iranian authorities accuse the U.S. and Israel of fomenting trouble and called for a nationwide rally on Monday to condemn ""terrorist actions led by the United States and Israel"" in Iran, state media reported. The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
Footage posted on social media on Saturday from Tehran showed large crowds marching along a street at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd ""has no end nor beginning,"" a man is heard saying.
In footage from the northeastern city of Mashhad, smoke can be seen billowing into the night sky from fires in the street, masked protesters, and a road strewn with debris, another video posted on Saturday showed. Explosions could be heard. State TV showed dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroner's office, saying the dead were victims of events caused by ""armed terrorists"", as well as footage of loved ones gathered outside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran waiting to identify bodies.
Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any U.S. intervention.
An Israeli military official said the protests were an internal Iranian matter, but Israel's military was monitoring developments and was ready to respond ""with power if need be"". Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, which the United States briefly joined by attacking key nuclear installations. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar. IRAN DENOUNCES 'RIOTERS AND TERRORISTS'
While the Iranian authorities have weathered previous protests, the latest have unfolded with Tehran still recovering from last year's war and with its regional position weakened by blows to allies such as Lebanon's Hezbollah since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks against Israel.
Iran's unrest comes as Trump flexes U.S. muscles on the world stage, having ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and floating the possibility of acquiring Greenland by purchase or military force.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a TV interview, said Israel and the U.S. were masterminding destabilisation and that Iran's enemies had brought in ""terrorists ... who set mosques on fire .... attack banks, and public properties"".
""Families, I ask you: do not allow your young children to join rioters and terrorists who behead people and kill others,"" he said, adding that the government was ready to listen to the people and to resolve economic problems.
Alan Eyre, a former U.S. diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple the establishment.
""I think it more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker,"" he told Reuters, noting that Iran's elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition.
Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for security personnel killed in protests.
State TV said 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan and that six more were killed by ""rioters"" in Kermanshah in the west.
US READY TO HELP, SAYS TRUMP
Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: ""Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!""
In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source present for the conversation.
Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, said Trump had observed Iranians' ""indescribable bravery"". ""Do not abandon the streets,"" Pahlavi, who is based in the U.S., wrote on X.
Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, a Paris-based Iranian opposition group, wrote on X that people in Iran had ""asserted control of public spaces and reshaped Iran's political landscape"".
Her group, also known as Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK), joined the 1979 revolution but later broke from the ruling clerics and fought them during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.
Netanyahu, speaking during a cabinet meeting, said Israel was closely monitoring developments. ""We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from the yoke of tyranny,"" he said.",geopolitical_economy

The shift follows softer non-farm payrolls data and reflects signs of a gradually weakening labor market, alongside stronger-than-expected GDP growth and fading tariff impacts. After the latest payrolls report, we see the Fed waiting until mid-year to cut as inflation falls toward the target and the labor market finds its footing, according to Goldman.Goldman now expects the Fed funds rate to end 2026 at 3-3.25%, and has reduced its 12-month recession probability to 20% from 30%.
The brokerage said the revised timeline was driven by ""meaningful progress in 2025 that was masked by a moderate one-time boost from tariffs,"" and a labor market that, while stabilizing, remains at risk of further softening.

09-01-2026,global,Reuters,Fed seen on longer rate-cut pause after December jobs data,"A drop in the unemployment rate may ease concerns at the U.S. central bank about labor market weakness, with traders betting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has delivered his last interest rate cut before his term ends in May and leaving any further policy easing in the hands of whomever President Donald Trump taps as Powell's successor.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.4% last month from a revised 4.5% in November, the U.S. Labor Department reported on Friday, even as employers added 50,000 jobs in the month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 60,000.Powell led the Fed into reducing its benchmark overnight interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point last year in a bid to keep the job market from softening further, even as his more hawkish colleagues argued that doing so could slow or even imperil progress on bringing down above-target inflation.
The latest job market data appears to give the central bank a bit of breathing room to leave short-term borrowing costs where they are to keep up the pressure on inflation, as Powell last month signaled policymakers are inclined to do at least in the near term.
December's modest job growth is ""very much in line with the businesses I am talking to, which is that the low-hire environment continues,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin told reporters, noting the reluctance to hire is due to uncertainty about the economy and also to higher productivity that allows firms to get by with less labor.While it is an ""uncomfortable"" fact that hiring is concentrated in only a narrow set of industries, he said he feels labor supply and job growth are in reasonable balance. That view suggests he's not in a rush to cut rates to support the job market.
Traders of rate futures tied to the Fed's policy rate now see just a 44% chance of a rate cut by April, versus about even odds previously, with a resumption of rate cuts in June seen as the far more likely scenario.
â€œInflation is still too high,"" said Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic in a radio interview following the jobs report, calling for a laser-like focus on that part of the Fed's mandate.
Both Bostic and Barkin are on the hawkish side of the Fed's policy spectrum,and neither votes on monetary policy decisions in 2026.
Powell's term as Fed chief ends on May 15. Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Powell for failing to deliver the large rate cuts the president desires, has said he has decided on a successor who supports further reductions in borrowing costs. An announcement is expected this month.The drop in the U.S. jobless rate in December ""should douse the Fed's recent urgency to backstop a weakening labor market,"" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. ""That said, the weak headline job-growth story can't be brushed aside. Hiring is still stuck in stall speed, and job growth in the cyclical parts of the economy isn't sending a comforting signal.""
U.S. employers added only 548,000 jobs in 2025, compared with about 2 million in 2024, the data on Friday showed. The number of those out of work and still seeking a job for more than half a year now account for more than a quarter of the unemployed, and the number of people in part-time jobs because they couldn't find full-time work was up sharply compared with a few months ago.
""The risks are skewed toward a pick-up in layoffs ahead,"" economists at Pantheon Macro noted, suggesting continued pressure for more Fed easing even while Powell is still at the central bank's helm, perhaps as soon as March. Traders currently see less than a 30% chance of a rate cut by then.There is plenty more data still to come before Powell steps down as Fed chief, including benchmark revisions to labor market data next month that are widely expected to show hiring was even slower than has been reported.
""The Fed will remain very open to the possibility that underlying softening could still nudge the unemployment rate and other measures of slack higher again in the next couple of months by enough to warrant a cut in March,"" Evercore ISI Vice Chairman Krishna Guha wrote. ""But overall we see some support here for our view that more likely than not the Fed will keep rates on hold until June, when it will deliver its first cut under the new chair.""",economy
20-12-2025,japan,Reuters,Yen weakens against peers after BOJ raises interest rates,"The yen weakened sharply against the dollar and other major peer currencies on Friday after the Bank of Japan raised rates to a 30-year high but did not offer clarity on future hikes.
The yen fell against the dollar after the BOJ lifted its policy rate to 0.75% from 0.5% in a move that had been well-telegraphed by policymakers, prompting traders to sell. Losses in the Japanese currency extended after BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's post-meeting press conference, where he remained vague on the exact timing and pace of future rate hikes and said only that the door was open to further tightening. The dollar rose as high as 157.67 against the Japanese yen, its strongest level in four weeks and on track for its largest one-day rise since early October. It was last up 1.23% at 157.535 yen.
The euro hit a record high of 184.71 yen while the Swiss franc hit an all-time high of 197.23 yen . Sterling rose by as much as 1.36% to its highest since 2008, at 210.96 yen .
""I think most of the currencies are consolidating but the big one, of course, is the yen,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.
""The BOJ delivered a rate hike like everybody expected and indicated that they will continue to raise should the economy evolve as they expect. The yen is weaker across the board. I think many people are saying that the BOJ was not hawkish enough,"" Chandler added.In Friday's statement, the BOJ maintained its view that underlying inflation will converge around its 2% target in the latter half of its three-year projection period through fiscal 2027. It reiterated that real rates were at ""significantly"" low levels even after the hike, and pledged to continue tightening should the economy and inflation pan out as forecast.
But none of this was enough to halt the slide in the yen.
Traders have started to consider the chances of official intervention to support the currency once the yen crossed the 155 level against the dollar in November.
The last time Tokyo authorities stepped into the market to intervene was July 2024, when the dollar/yen rate hit 161.96, the most since the mid-1980s.
Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama warned on Friday that Tokyo would take appropriate action to deal with any excessive volatility in the foreign exchange market. ""We will respond appropriately to excessive moves, including those driven by speculators,"" she said.
""We would fade that dovish BOJ narrative,"" said Elias Hadad, global head of markets strategy at BBH in an investor note. ""In our view, the bar for additional BOJ rate hikes is low. First, the BOJ warned that 'the risk of firms' active wage-setting behavior being interrupted is low', implying that underlying wage and inflation pressure are likely to persist. Second, BOJ Governor Ueda pointed out the policy rate is still some distance from the lower end of the neutral rate range.""

European Union leaders decided on Friday to borrow cash to fund Ukraine's defence against Russia for the next two years rather than use frozen Russian assets, sidestepping divisions over an unprecedented plan to finance Kyiv with Russian sovereign cash.
The euro held steady at $1.1720. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde on Thursday offered no forward guidance and said all options were on the table, pushing back against more hawkish members. The ECB left its policy rate on hold at 2%, as expected. Sterling round-tripped to sit at $1.3388 after the Bank of England cut interest rates to 3.75%, as expected, but the decision was closer-run than the market had anticipated, which may limit the room for further easing.
Overnight, the dollar had briefly weakened following a sharp and unexpected fall in U.S. inflation, but investors were not sure how far to trust the data since collection was interrupted by the U.S. government shutdown, and the move soon retraced.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar strengthened 0.06% versus the greenback to $0.66175 while the kiwi weakened 0.23% versus the greenback to $0.57619.
The dollar was flat at 7.0342 versus the offshore Chinese yuan.
