# Limitation 

While Arin Intelligence Provide structured insights into economic trends through news analysis and public indicators, the project has several limitations that sould be acknowledged.

1. The analysis relies on publicly available economic news and datasets, which may contain reporting bias, delays, or incomplete information. News coverage often emphasizes cetain regions, events, or narratives more than others, which can influence sentiment analysis results and observed trends.

2. Entiment analysis applied to economic news is inherently approximate. Natural Language processing techniques may not fully capture contextual naunces, sarcasm, or complex economic interpretations present in expert reporting. As a result, sentiment scores should be interpreted as indicative paterns rather than precise measurements.

3. The project focuses on batch-based analysis rather than real-time data processing. Economic conditions can change rapidly, and the insights generated reflect historical data up to the time of collection rather than live market dynamics.

Additionally, Arin Intelligence prioritize interpretability and exploratory analysis over predictive modeling. The project does not attempt to forecast future economic outcomes, and the results should not be interpreted as financial or economic predictions.
Finally, the scope of the project is constained by time, data availability, and computational simplicity. More advanced modeling techniques, larger datasets, or domain-specific economic models could potentially provides deeper insights but are beyond the current scope of this work.
