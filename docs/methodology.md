# Methodology

Arin Intelligence follows a structured and reproducible analytical workflow designed to transform raw economic infromation into interpretable insights. The methodology begins with the collection of economic news articles and publicly available economic indicators from reliable sources.

The collected news data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise, normalize text, and handle missing or inconsistent information. This step ensures that unstructured textual data can be analyzed in a consistent and meaningful way. Structured economic datasets are also cleaned and aligned to maintain consistency across time periods and indicators.

After preprocessing, exploratory data analysis is performed to understand distributions, trends, and relationships within the data. Sentiment analysis techniques are applied to economic news content to capture shifts in tone and narrative over time. these results are then examined anlongside quantitative economic indicators to identify observable pattern and potential correlation.

The final stage of the methodology focuses on the visualization and interpretation. Graphs and summary tables are used to present trends and insights clearly, enabling easier reasoning about economic behavior. The methodology prioritizes transparency, interpretability, and reproducibility rather than complex predictive modeling.
